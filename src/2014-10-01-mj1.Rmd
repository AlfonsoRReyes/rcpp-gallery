Some math with conditional mathjax support. Same markup is used in both cases.

```
$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$
```

## Inline

Inline HTML markup generated based on the absence of "additional" linebreaks.

Example 1: $$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

Example 2:
$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

## Display

Display HTML markup generated based on the presence of a buffer linebreak.

Example 3:

$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$
