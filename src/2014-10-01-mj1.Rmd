Some math with conditional mathjax support. Same markup is used in both cases.

```
$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$
```

## Inline

Inline HTML markup generated based on the absence of "additional" linebreaks.

Example 1: $$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

Example 2:
$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

## Display

Display HTML markup generated based on the presence of a buffer linebreak.

Example 3:

$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

## Tests 1

This is not kramdown  math, so it should not render. \$$ asdfasdf $$

This is not kramdown math, so it should not render.

\$\$ asdfasdf $$

## Tests 2

### fonts

$$
\widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y *asdf* _asdf_ **asdf**
$$

### lists

$$
\widehat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y

- a
- b
- c
$$

### pipes

fails $$|x|=1$$

works $$\vert x \vert = 1$$

and works

$$
|x|=1
$$
